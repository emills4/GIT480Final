                            "The Hof" as locals know it wouldn't be here if it wasn't for a 
                            dedicated stream of staff and clientele who believe that a coffee house
                             is more than just a place to buy coffee. It's also a place to meet 
                             people, create community, and think. The great Coffee Houses of the 
                             world have have been gathering places for poets, intellectuals, and 
                             revolutionaries; they have allowed the wild thoughts of inventors and 
                             entrepreneurs to have space and time to run free; perhaps coffee 
                             houses have also cloaked those who wish to hide out, who wish not to 
                             be found ... who wish simply to be.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Clark Family, who also own and operate Goose Hollow Inn next door, 
                            opened The Hof in 2001, after the space had served for years as a break 
                            room, shop, walk-in cooler, and apartment ... among other things.  It's 
                            name, Fehrenbacher Hof, honors Sigrid Antonia Fehrenbacher, wife of 
                            former Mayor Bud Clark, the proprietor of Goose Hollow Inn. It also 
                            honors Frieda Fehrenbacher, artist and professor. The coffee house is 
                            decorated with antique toasters, egg beaters, violins, and various other 
                            items from Sigrid's collections as both a violinist and antique dealer; 
                            and the back room features a fantastic piece of Frieda's work, Hephaestus
                             breaking open Zeus's skull to birth Athena. Bud chose this artwork for 
                             the Hof from Frieda's collection, thinking that it well-expressed the 
                             headache we all sometimes feel when we really want our cup of coffee! 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Well, maybe we can't rid you of your headache, but maybe a visit to our 
                            corner of the world will bring you a moment of respite, a sip of pleasure, 
                            a new insight, a reason to meet with a friend and rekindle a relationship.
